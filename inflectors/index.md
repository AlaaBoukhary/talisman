The `inflectors` module gathers the library's various inflectors.

Inflectors are algorithms aiming at inflecting words, i.e. conjugating them or switching them from plural/singular etc.

They are commonly used in fuzzy matching routines and information retrieval to be able to return useful results to users. Indeed, when someone types `house` in a search form, it is likely that they are also interested in finding texts containing `houses` also.
