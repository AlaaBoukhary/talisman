The `tokenizers/words` module gathers the library's various words tokenizers.

Words tokenizers take raw text and output a list of this text's words.

## Summary

* [naive](#naive)
* [treebank](#treebank)

This words tokenizer is actually lodash's [words](https://lodash.com/docs#words) function re-exported for convenience.

It's quite robust and works in a lot of simple cases.

```js
import words from 'talisman/tokenizers/words';

words('Hello World!');
>>> ['Hello', 'World']
```

<div id="naive-mount"></div>

<h2 id="treebank">treebank</h2>

This words tokenizer is one of the most popular regular expression tokenizers for the English language.

It is able to split expressions such as *isn't* into two proper tokens.

Note that it won't strip punctuation and keep it as tokens.

```js
import treebank from 'talisman/tokenizers/words/treebank';

treebank("It wasn't me!");
>>> ['It', 'was', 'n\'t', 'me', '!']
```

<div id="treebank-mount"></div>
