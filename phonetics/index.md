The `phonetics` module aims at gathering various algorithms whose goal is to produce an approximative phonetic representation of the given strings.

This phonetic representation is then really useful when performing fuzzy matching.

The algorithms presented in this page generally work for the English language (even if they somewhat extend to a variety of european languages for some of them).

This said, the library also offers phonetic algorithms targeting other [languages](#languages), such as [French]({{ site.baseurl }}/phonetics/french) for instance.

## Summary

Modules under the `talisman/phonetics` namespace:

* [caverphone](#caverphone)
* [daitch-mokotoff](#daitch-mokotoff)
* [double-metaphone](#double-metaphone)
* [metaphone](#metaphone)
* [mra](#mra)
* [nysiis](#nysiis)
* [soundex](#soundex)

<h2 id="languages">Phonetic algorithms for other languages</h2>

* [french]({{ site.baseurl }}/phonetics/french)
* [german]({{ site.baseurl }}/phonetics/german)

## Use case

Let's say we want to compare two fairly similar names like *Catherine* & *Kathryn*.

One human would very easily agree that those two names do sound the same.

But, for a computer, stating this simple fact is daunting since:

```js
'Catherine' !== 'Kathryn'
```

Phonetic algorithms are therefore a way to solve this problem because they will try to produce a phonetic representation of the given strings that can be used to match them if they sound roughly the same.

```js
// Using the metaphone algorithm, for instance
import metaphone from 'talisman/phonetics/metaphone';

const catherineCode = metaphone('Catherine'),
      kathrynCode = metaphone('Kathryn');

catherineCode
>>> 'K0RN'

kathrynCode
>>> 'K0RN'

catherineCode === kathrynCode
>>> true
```

The caverphone algorithm, written by David Hood for the Caversham project, aims at encoding names and specifically targeting names from New Zealand.

However, this shouldn't stop you from trying it on any dataset.

The library packs both the original & the revisited version of the algorithm.

```js
import caverphone from 'talisman/phonetics/caverphone';
// Alternatively
import {original, revisited} from 'talisman/phonetics/caverphone';

caverphone === original
>>> true

caverphone('Henrichsen');
>>> 'ANRKSN1111'

revisited('Henrichsen')
>>> 'ANRKSN1111'
```

</span>

The Daitch-Mokotoff Soundex is a refinement of the American [Soundex](#soundex) to match more properly Slavic & Yiddish names.

Note that sometimes, this algorithm give different solutions for encoding a sound.

Thus, the function will always return an array of possible encodings listing all the possible permutations (at least one, obviously).

```js
import daitchMokotoff from 'talisman/phonetics/daitch-mokotoff';

daitchMokotoff('Peters');
>>> ['739400', '734000']
```

</span>

The double metaphone algorithm, created in 2000 by Lawrence Philips, is an improvement over the original [metaphone](#metaphone) algorithm.

It is called "double" because the algorithm will try to produce two possibilities for the phonetic encoding of the given string.

Note however, that unlike the original metaphone, the length of the produced code will never exceed 4 characters.

```js
import doubleMetaphone from 'talisman/phonetics/double-metaphone';

doubleMetaphone('Smith');
>>> ['SM0', 'XMT']
```

<div id="double-metaphone-mount"></div>

</span>

The metaphone algorithm, created in 1990 by Lawrence Philips, is a phonetic algorithm working on dictionary words (rather than only processing names, as phonetic algorithms usually do).

Note also that the algorithm will not truncate the given word to output a codex limited to a specific number of letters.

Today, however, we often prefer to use the "improved" version of the algorithm called the [double metaphone](#double-metaphone).

```js
import metaphone from 'talisman/phonetics/metaphone';

metaphone('Michael');
>>> 'MXL'
```

<div id="metaphone-mount"></div>

</span>

This algorithm will compute the Match Rating Approach codex used by the same method to establish the similarity between two names.

This function is exported by the library for reference, but you should probably use [`talisman/metrics/mra`]({{ site.baseurl }}/metrics#mra) instead.

```js
import mra from 'talisman/phonetics/mra';

mra('Kathryn');
>>> 'KTHRYN'
```

</span>

The New York State Identification and Intelligence System is basically a more modern alternative to the original [Soundex](#soundex).

Like its counterpart, it has been created to match names and is not really suited for dictionary words.

The library packs both the original and the refined version of the algorithm.

```js
import nysiis from 'talisman/phonetics/nysiis';
// Alternatively
import {original, refined} from 'talisman/phonetics/nysiis';

nysiis === original
>>> true

nysiis('Philbert');
>>> 'FFALBAD'

nysiis('Philbert');
>>> 'FALBAD'
```

</span>

The Soundex algorithm, created by Robert Russell and Margaret Odell, is often considered to be the first phonetic algorithm in history.

Note that it aims at matching anglo-saxons names and won't work well on dictionary words.

You are also free to use the refined version of this algorithm, as found in the Apache projects.

```js
import soundex from 'talisman/phonetics/soundex';
// Alternatively
import {refined} from 'talisman/phonetics/refined';

soundex('Michael');
>>> 'M240'

refined('Michael');
>>> 'M80307'
```
