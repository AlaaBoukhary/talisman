The caverphone algorithm, written by David Hood for the Caversham project, aims at encoding names and specifically targeting names from New Zealand.

However, this shouldn't stop you from trying it on any dataset.

The library packs both the original & the revisited version of the algorithm.

```js
import caverphone from 'talisman/phonetics/caverphone';
// Alternatively
import {original, revisited} from 'talisman/phonetics/caverphone';

caverphone === original
>>> true

caverphone('Henrichsen');
>>> 'ANRKSN1111'

revisited('Henrichsen')
>>> 'ANRKSN1111'
```

The metaphone algorithm, created in 1990 by Lawrence Philips, is a phonetic algorithm working on dictionary words (rather than only processing names, as phonetic algorithms usually do).

Note also that the algorithm will not truncate the given word to output a codex limited to a specific number of letters.

Today, however, we often prefer to use the "improved" version of the algorithm called the [double metaphone](#double-metaphone).

```js
import metaphone from 'talisman/phonetics/metaphone';

metaphone('Michael');
>>> 'MXL'
```

</span>

The Soundex algorithm, created by Robert Russell and Margaret Odell, is often considered to be the first phonetic algorithm in history.

Note that it aims at matching anglo-saxons names and won't work well on dictionary words.

```js
import soundex from 'talisman/phonetics/soundex';

soundex('Michael');
>>> 'M240'
```
